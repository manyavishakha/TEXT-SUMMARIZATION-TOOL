INTERN ID : :CT08FZQ

DOMAIN : ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

BATCH DURATION : December 25th, 2024 to January 25th, 2025

MENTOR NAME : NEELA SANTHOSH

DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK: THIS PROJECT CONTAINS INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS PLATFORMS LIKE YOUTUBE, GOOGLE , META AI , CHAT GPT AND MANY OTHER WEBSITES. UNDERSTANDING THE GOAL WHAT WE HAVE TO BUILD, IT'S A PYTHON SCRIPT THAT SUMMARIZES LONG ARTICLES INTO SHORT SUMMARY. FOR THIS SCRIPT I TOOK HELP FROM MENTOR AND FROM THE YOUTUBE VIDEO. I GOT TO KNOW ABOUT ALL THESE FROM LINKDLN AND WHATSAPP GROUP WHICH KEEP US UPDATED BY PROVIDING THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THIS COURSE AND ALSO, OUR MENTOR HELPS US IN EVERY WAY TO MAKE US UNDERSTAND THE TASK EASYILY. THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT SUMMARIZATION TOOL WHICH KEEP ARTICLES SHORT TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT QUICKLY. THIS HELPS STUDENTS AS WELL AS PROFESSIONALS AND RESEARCHERS TO EFFICIENTLY SUMMARIZES LARGE SIZE OF TEXTS AND SAVES A LOT OF TIME . IT FOCUSES ON KEY POINTS WITHOUT READING WHOLE DATA AND INFORMATION. USERS CAN USE THE DESIRED SUMMARY LENGHT ACCORDING TO THEIR WANTS AND IDENTIFIES KEY PHRASES OR TERMS IN SHORT PARAGRAPHS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK TEAM.OF CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE US THIS WOMNDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW ABOUT SOMETHING VERY NEW AND DIFFERENT FROM MY FIELD. IT'S REALLY A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME TO DO A PROJECT ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS. NOW I WOULD TO SHARE THAT HOW I CAME TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PLATFORM. I WAS GOING THOROUGH LINKDLN AND SUDDENLY CAME ACROSS THOROUGH A POST REGARDING INTERNSHIP. NOW I WANT TO TELL ABOUT WHAT INFORMATION IS GIVEN ON THIS PROJECT SO IT'S MY FIRST TASK ON TOPIC- TEXT SUMMARIZATION TOOLS THAT SUMMARIZES LONG ARTICLES INTO SHORT SUMMARY. ITS A FIRST TASK FROM COURSE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. Here's a basic design for a tool that summarizes lengthy articles using natural language processing (NLP) techniques:

Tool Name: AutoSumm Technologies Used

Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLTK, spaCy
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, TensorFlow
Web Development: Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
NLP Techniques Used

Tokenization: breaking down text into individual words or tokens
Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: identifying the grammatical category of each word
Named Entity Recognition (NER): identifying named entities, such as people, organizations, and locations
Dependency Parsing: analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences
TextRank: a graph-based algorithm for text summarization
Tool Components

Text Input: user inputs the lengthy article
Preprocessing: tokenization, POS tagging, NER, dependency parsing
Summary Generation: TextRank algorithm to generate summary
Postprocessing: ranking sentences based on relevance and coherence
Summary Output: displaying the summarized article
How it Works

User inputs the lengthy article into the tool.
The tool preprocesses the text using NLP techniques.
The tool generates a summary using the TextRank algorithm.
The tool postprocesses the summary by ranking sentences based on relevance and coherence.
The tool displays the summarized article to the user.
Code Structure

(link unavailable): Flask app that handles user input and displays the summarized article
(link unavailable): NLP module that performs preprocessing, summary generation, and postprocessing
(link unavailable): TextRank algorithm implementation
(link unavailable): machine learning models for sentence ranking and coherence evaluation
templates/index.html: HTML template for user input and summary display
